# 👋 Hey, I'm Safdar

I'm a Computer Science student at **Wilfrid Laurier University** and a **freelance Product Designer** with 7+ years of experience turning ideas into digital products that feel simple, human, and meaningful.

I enjoy building things that sit at the intersection of **design and technology** — where usability meets creativity.  
Whether it's designing interfaces, writing clean code, or leading teams, I care about the details that make experiences truly enjoyable.
